; Use SPI to send an 8-bit code to the LCD.

; As part of Lab 7, students need to implement these outcommand and outdata
; This driver assumes two low-level LCD functions
; this file is in the inc folder so it automatically will be applied to labs 7 8 9 and 10

; ***********SPIOutCommand*****************
; This is a helper function that sends an 8-bit command to the LCD.
; Inputs: R0 = 32-bit command (number)
;         R1 = 32-bit SPI status register address
;         R2 = 32-bit SPI data register address
;         R3 = 32-bit GPIO port address for D/C
; Outputs: none
; Assumes: SPI and GPIO have already been initialized and enabled
; Note: must be AAPCS compliant
; Note: access to bit 6 of GPIO must be friendly
SPIOutCommand
; --UUU-- Code to write a command to the LCD
;1) Read the SPI status register (R1 has address) and check bit 4, 
;2) If bit 4 is high, loop back to step 1 (wait for BUSY bit to be low)
;3) Clear D/C (GPIO bit 6) to zero, be friendly (R3 has address)
;4) Write the command to the SPI data register (R2 has address)
;5) Read the SPI status register (R1 has address) and check bit 4, 
;6) If bit 4 is high, loop back to step 5 (wait for BUSY bit to be low)

; ***********SPIOutData*****************
; This is a helper function that sends an 8-bit data to the LCD.
; Inputs: R0 = 32-bit data (number)
;         R1 = 32-bit SPI status register address
;         R2 = 32-bit SPI data register address
;         R3 = 32-bit GPIO port address for D/C
; Outputs: none
; Assumes: SPI and GPIO have already been initialized and enabled
; Note: must be AAPCS compliant
; Note: access to bit 6 of GPIO must be friendly
SPIOutData
; --UUU-- Code to write data to the LCD
;1) Read the SPI status register (R1 has address) and check bit 1, 
;2) If bit 1 is low, loop back to step 1 (wait for TNF bit to be high)
;3) Set D/C (GPIO bit 6) to one, be friendly (R3 has address)
;4) Write the data to the SPI data register (R2 has address)
